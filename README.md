# EMPOWER 2.0
The focus of the application is helping prosumers in their effort to make a green energy community. Our goal is to to create inspirational examples of features for the digital platform EMPOWER 2.0 by exploring visualization possibilities using data from Dutch open sources and combining three different types of information: the number of initiatives in a place and its characteristics, the renewable energy production of different areas in the Netherlands and, mainly, the capacity of production of each area.

The files are located in two folders. One is the code of the data transformation and the other is the code of the website/prototype.
